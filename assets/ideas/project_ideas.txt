# Here is my plan for how to show/walkthrough the projects I have done:

1. Explain the big picture. What was the problem trying to be solved and why is it important?

2. Data used, methods, so on

3. Visuals/results/so on

4. Highlight your learning, reflections, and how it solved or met the companies needs.





# Here I am just brainstorming some possible projects I have done that I could maybe include.
## Here are the main ones I want to include in my project section so far
1. AJ PowerBI dashboard. Have the project be for the Legal Clinic metric visability thing I did and then also share the leadership dashboards too.


2. Clean Water Project (R Studio) Modeling/stats/governance/social impact


3. 


## Some other projects to consider adding in the future
4. PUG Projects that I have done for courses


5. Smart Home Dashboard (Home Assistant, Raspberry Pi)


6. WLED Light Strip Project


7. PowerBI Spotify
